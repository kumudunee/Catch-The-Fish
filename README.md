# Catch-The-Fish
Capture The Flag (CTF) Hacking

## Introduction
A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a competition that takes major disciplines of
information security and makes them into smaller, objectively measurable
exercises. Participants may attempt to solve challenges by solving, exploiting,
or breaking. This CTF event mainly focus on vulnerability assessment and
penetration testing skills.
Jeopardy, Attack defend and mixed are the types of CTFs.
In Jeopardy there are puzzles and we have to solve the puzzle to acquire the
toke or the flag. The flag may be hidden inside the text file, folders, or images
etc. These challenges may include OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, or any other
misconfiguration.
Attack defend type focuses on either attacking the opposite side or defending
the own.
The combination of both attack defend and Jeopardy is known as the mixed
type of CTF.
Further we can categorize CTF as web, forensics, miscellaneous, networking,
reversing, pwn/exploit. CTF challenges may cover many viewpoints of cyber
security such as reverse engineering, binary analysis, mobile security etc.
Computer security students can have benefit from applying security tools and
defend vulnerable systems. Working on pre-defined hacking challenges gives
common practice on security education. CTF challenges may help us to gain
the ability to vulnerability scanning and pen testing. 

## Architecture
Catch the Fish (CTF) game has 10 unique levels which needs to be think
creative and capture the relevant flag as the key to the next level. Sometimes
the Flag will be a password, a Hint or might be a motivational quote.
First five levels we counted as easy Levels then from 6 to 8 as Medium Levels
and Final two as Hard Level tasks.

*User Enters the interface which the levels are available in the web
view. For each and every level, we planned to create separate web
pages with relevant bounty holes.

*To pass a level, user need to submit the previous flag at the
beginning. For an example, User need to know enter level 01 flag to
enter the level 02.

*For the Forensic Level, User has to download the relevant
document and crack by a tool which user chooses. 

*For the shell type Levels, we have planned to give Kali Linux VM
image with relevant tools to exploit the relevant programs.


## Theme Audience

**Theme**

 Here the player who own the fish may win the game. They
may windup each level by catching up the fish. In each level the players have
to change the fishing tackle. First five levels are known as Shallow End Zone.
In the shallow end zone we have planned to create few freely accessible
levels with basic fundamentals of information security and forensic. Medium
zone changes and challenger deep zone challenges are created with a wide
rage of categories in forensic. Medium zone catching and challenger deeper catching are pain options. According to the fishing law rule, players cannot
access to the fishing zones as their wish. 

**Audience**

Here our main target is to measure the forensic knowledge of internship
candidates in cyber security related organizations. Before entering as an
intern an individual has to face a technological exam. Catch The Fish is used
to measure the knowledge of each trainer. We have lined up each level from
very easy level to difficult level. It is easy to measure up the trainerâ€™s
knowledge by looking at the number of levels he/she has completed.
This contain 10 levels which are different to each other. Skills you may get by
playing this CTF are recognizing formats, encoding, ways of encoding.
